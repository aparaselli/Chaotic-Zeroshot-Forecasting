We take one vertical tow with a Wisconsin Net (80um mesh) and a series of Schindler Patalas (53um mesh) samples spanning the water column. All samples are preserved in cold 95percent EtOH.After collection we combine subsamples of the individual Schindler Patalas trap samples to create one hypsometrically pooled sample for each lakeordate. The individual depth samples are discarded after pooling except from one August sampling date per year. The Hypsometrically Pooled sample and the Wisconsin Net sample are archived in the UW Zoology museum.We count zooplankton in one or two subsamples each representing 1.8L of lake water of the hypsometrically pooled samples to calculate zooplankton abundance. We count one sample date per month from the open water season and the February ice cover sample.  We identify individuals to genus or species take length measurements and count eggs and embryos.Protocol log:  1981-May1984 -- a 0.5m high 31L Schindler Patalas trap with 80um mesh net was used. Two Wisconsin Net tows were collected. Preservative was 12percent buffered formalin.June1984 -- changed to 53um mesh net on Schindler trap.July1986 -- began using the 2m high 45L Schindler Patalas trap. Changed WI Net collection to take only one tow.2001 -- changed zooplankton preservative from 12percent buffered formalin to 95percent EtOH.The number of sample dates per year counted varies with lake and year from 5 datesoryear to 17 datesoryear.1981-1983 -- pooled samples are of several types: Total Pooled (TP) were created using equal volume subsamples of the Schindler samples. Epi Meta Hypo pooled used equal volume subsamples from the Schindler samples collected from each of the thermal strata. Strata Pooled used equal volume subsamples from the Epi Meta Hypo pooled samples to create an entire lake sample. Hypsometrically Pooled (HP) is our standard which uses subsample volumes weighted to represent the hypsometry of the lake.
