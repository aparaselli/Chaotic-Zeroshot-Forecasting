cleaning steps
1. picked genuses with most data points: [dia, ]
2. rounded observation dates to that month's first date (march 15 -> march 1st)
3. for some dates/months, there were multiple observations, sometimes at slightly different locations (indicated by longitude, latitude). these were mean aggregated, resulting in one value for each month
4. missing months were imputed with NaNs as Chronos has a built-in mechanism to handle missing values.
