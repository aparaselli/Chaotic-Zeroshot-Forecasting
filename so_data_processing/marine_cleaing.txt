cleaning steps
1. picked genuses with most data points
2. rounded observation dates to that week's monday
3. for some weeks, there were multiple observations, sometimes one day apart. these were mean aggregated, resulting in one value for each week
4. missing weeks were imputed with NaNs as Chronos has a built-in mechanism to handle missing values.
